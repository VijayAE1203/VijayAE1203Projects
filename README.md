- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Vijay Lakshmanan
- ðŸ‘€ I have a Master's in Automotive Engineering and I am currently working as a Test Engineer for John Deere
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning software development and trying to implement them in a few projects that would help me develop my skills & knowledge
- ðŸŒ± I'm posting my projects in Github to store them securely
- ðŸŒ± I'm uploading each project as a subfolder. Each project would have its own README that would atleast give a high-level detail on what the project is aiming to achieve
- ðŸ“« If you have any questions, you can reach me at vjlatchu@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can mess up multiple things simultaneously!
