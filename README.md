- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, This is Vijay Lakshmanan
- ğŸ‘€ I have a Master's in Automotive Engineering and I am currently working as a Test Engineer for John Deere
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in this field and I do some personal projects for fun and learning which I will be uploading here
- ğŸŒ± Each project will be under a subfolder and will have its own README that will give a high-level overview on what the project is aiming to achieve
- ğŸ“« If you have any questions, you can reach me at vjlatchu@gmail.com
