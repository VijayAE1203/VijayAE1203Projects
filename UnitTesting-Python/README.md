This is a small project that implements unit testing in python using pytest.
A function that classifies the obstacles into different categories as Close, Mid and Far based on distances is created.
A custom exception for handling negative distance is created.
A test with 2 scenarios: 1 with positive distance and 2 with negative distance is used to evaluate the function.
